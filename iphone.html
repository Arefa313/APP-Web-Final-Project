      <h2>what is an iphone?</h2>
      <p>The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by <mark>Apple Inc</mark>. It runs on Apple's iOS operating system and has been a popular choice for consumers since its launch in 2007. The iPhone has gone through several iterations and has introduced new features such as Face ID, dual-camera systems, and advanced display technologies.
        The original iPhone was announced on Jan. 9, 2007, at the Macworld convention by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.<br><br> While it was not considered the first smartphone, the iPhone has helped drive the global shift to mobile computing among both consumers and businesses. Its primary rival has been Google Android-based devices from companies such as Samsung, also introduced in 2007.
    
    The first-generation iPhone came preloaded with a suite of Apple software, including iTunes, the Safari web browser and iPhoto. Internet Message Access Protocol and Post Office Protocol 3 email services were integrated with the device.

    <h3>What's the best iPhone right now?</h3>
    <p>The best iPhone for most people is the $799<mark> iPhone 15</mark>. It has one of Apple's most recent processors, the A16 Bionic chip found in last year's iPhone 14 Pro, meaning it should support new software features for years to come. The iPhone 15 has the best balance of camera performance and features that will feel new to those coming from older iPhones. 

      The iPhone 15's 6.1-inch size is also small enough to use with one hand but large enough to comfortably read the news and watch videos. It's the cheapest phone in the iPhone 15 lineup, making it more accessible than the larger iPhone 15 Plus or more powerful iPhone 15 Pro. </p>
